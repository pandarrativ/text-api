## New API (Feb)

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/assistant 

node: @azure/openai-assistants

change compared with old version: There are roughly four concepts: assistant, thread, run, and message. You can create a thread with assistant, add message to the thread, and the context will be automatically understood after running.
